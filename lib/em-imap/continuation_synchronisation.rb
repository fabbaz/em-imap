module EventMachine
  module IMAP
    # The basic IMAP protocol is an unsynchronised exchange of lines,
    # however under some circumstances it is necessary to synchronise
    # so that the server acknowledges each item sent by the client.
    #
    # For example, this happens during authentication:
    #
    #  C: A0001 AUTHENTICATE LOGIN
    #  S: + 
    #  C: USERNAME
    #  S: +
    #  C: PASSWORD
    #  S: A0001 OK authenticated as USERNAME.
    #
    # And during the sending of literals:
    #
    #  C: A0002 SELECT {8}
    #  S: + continue
    #  C: All Mail
    #  S: A0002 OK
    #
    # In order to make this work this module allows part of the client
    # to block the outbound link while waiting for the continuation
    # responses that it is expecting.
